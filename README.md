# Stock-market-analysis

In this project I looked at data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. Used pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally analysed risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I processed 4 technology stocks information: Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon from yahoo and tried to answer the following questions:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
5.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
